 🗂️DSA_PROJECT_SANTOSHINI

This repository contains one mini-project and one major-project implemented in c++ using Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

💻 DSA Project 🎨

1. 🔐 OTP Generator ⚡

 ----Features----
🛡 Generates a random 4-digit OTP using C++'s <cstdlib> and <ctime> libraries for secure randomness.

🛡 Displays OTP with limited visibility, simulating a secure one-time code system.

2. 🔄 undo-redo ⚡

 ----Features----
🛡 This project implements a robust Undo/Redo functionality using stacks in C++.

🛡 Every user action is stored, allowing the system to revert (undo) or reapply (redo) changes efficiently.

🛡 It’s ideal for text editors, drawing apps, or any system requiring reversible user interactions.
